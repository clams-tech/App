## Contributing

This project is open source and contributions are welcome and encouraged! We are working towards having an open roadmap with a list of features we plan on implementing so that anyone who wants to help can pick a feature from the list. In the meantime if you find any bugs or want to implement a feature, try jumping in to our [Discord](https://discord.gg/eWfHuJZVaB) to discuss or create an [issue](https://github.com/clams-tech/browser-app/issues) on the repo.

### i18n

We would especially love help translating this app to languages other than English. If you have the ability to translate the text in the [en.json](/src/lib/i18n/en.json) file, please go ahead and create a pull request if you know how, otherwise reach out in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/eWfHuJZVaB) so that we can help you get a pull request open.
